# rusting-up
This repository contains code that I have written on my journey learning the Rust programming language. Hence I am calling it 'Rusting-Up'. 

# Progress
## Day 1
Created a first conventional Hello World program, and then the same program, but using Cargo. Learnt about some Rust program conventions, and some command lines. Finished Chapter 1. 
## Day 2
Jumped to Chapter 3. Finished testing out different scenarios possible with immutable variables, making them mutable, and shadowing variables. Also tested constants. 
## Day 3
Learnt about integer scalar data type. 
## Day 4
Learnt about floating point scalar data type. 
## Day 5 - 8
Learnt about the remaining scalar types- character and boolean variables. Then learnt about the Compound type variables- Tuples and Arrays. 
## Day 9
Learnt about Rust functions. 
## Day 10
Learnt about basic comments in Rust and added comments to the ***functions*** project.
